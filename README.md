# JSFundamentals Course Description

Come here to solidify your understanding of Objects, Arrays and Functions in JavaScript and learn the common mistakes made by beginners. This is a highly interactive course that uses exercises and projects to drive home these JS Fundamentals. You will finish this course with expert knowledge on one of the most important aspects of the language: objects, arrays and functions. 

# Course Format

The course is taught over 4 three-hour workshops. Two of these workshops consist of lectures and exercises that check the understanding of the material. The other two workshops are project-based where the fundamental concepts learned are put to use in independent projects with TAs helping each student at their level. The lectures and projects alternate.
