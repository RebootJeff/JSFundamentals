//change func so that it works with the for loop
//with semi colons
=================================================
var func = function(){};
for(var i = 0; i < func.length; i++){
  console.log(func[i]);
}
//change obj so that it works with the for loop

}

//write a function that changes an object into an array of it's values
//input => {one: 1, two: 2, three: 3, four: 4} 
//output => [1,2,3,4]

//now write a function that takes an object and creates and array of it's 
//properties
//input => {one: 1, two: 2, three: 3, four: 4} 
//output => ['one','two', 'three', 'four']

//what is the difference between a side effect of a function and
//what a function returns?

//use a ternary operator
